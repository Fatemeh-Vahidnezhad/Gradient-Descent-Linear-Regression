# Linear Regression Model

This repository contains a Python implementation of a simple Linear Regression model using gradient descent. 
The model is built from scratch to demonstrate how linear regression can be implemented without relying on 
high-level machine-learning libraries beyond NumPy for mathematical operations and pandas for data handling.

## Features

- **Linear Regression Algorithm**: Implementation of the basic linear regression using gradient descent.
- **NumPy and Pandas Integration**: Uses NumPy for calculations and pandas for data manipulation.
- **Customizable Training Cycles**: Allows the user to specify the number of iterations for the gradient descent algorithm.

## Installation

This project requires Python 3.6+ with the following packages installed:

- NumPy
- pandas
- scikit-learn

You can install the required packages using the command:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn
